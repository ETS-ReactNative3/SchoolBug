## Hi! You are coding on Schoolbus mobile.

## Setting up project:
#### 1. Firstly install Node.js, I recommend you to install Latest LTS Version.
Download Node.js here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
#### 2. Open the command line, terminal, powershell or anything similar to that:
```bash
npm install
```
If you have Error while installation, remove file package-lock.json and install again.
#### 3. Run in Schoolbus customer app.
```bash
npm run customer-android
```
or
```bash
npm run customer-ios
```
#### 4. Run in Schoolbus driver app.
```bash
npm run driver-android
```
or
```bash
npm run driver-ios
```
## About project:
**This project is the mobile app of Schoolbus, an application allow user to book car for their children to school**
**The core of project is built with Reactjs and React Native, you can visit the tutorial here https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html**
## Good practices:
#### 1. ECMAScript.
This project is using ECMAScript2015 (ES6) and the beyond version.
You'd better learn ES6 from here: https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/
We recommend you to use ES6 for developing instead of normal javascript, for the consistency and convenience.
#### 2. ESLint.
We recommend you to install ESLint extensions on Visual Studio Code (or the similar ones on other IDEs)
What is ESLint? Find out here: https://eslint.org/
Follow coding convention: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
Try to keep the codes cleaner and better in quality.
Tooltip: Try to use Prettier on Visual Studio Code, this will help you a lot while working with eslint.
#### 3. Update dependencies.
Find out here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates
Why should you update dependencies?
Although the project works well on the old version, many dependencies (including Expo) are currently in developing.
Updating frequently will help us be ready with the latest technology, with many new features updated in those libraries.
And the project may be enhanced in performance, besides, we are able to develop a feature with more ease in a shorter time :O

**Is this project cool? =)) well, we are trying to arrange everything in structure, so try to follow it.**
**If you find anything difficult or misunderstand, don't be shy to ask us for help!**
